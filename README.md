# LinkedList-lib

I will use this repository as a template Linked List as I realized I don't have one; there are thousands of Linked List libraries that are faster, more robust, and better documented, I don't recommend you use this, I am just writing this for fun.

# Archived

As this is only a thing I wrote for fun there isn't really much to add, as such I believe I have finalized it, if I do use this as a library for any future projects, I might update it and improve on it to an actual usable state. But as I said before, do not use it.
